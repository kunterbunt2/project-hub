# Design Philosophy

- As simple as possible, as complex as necessary.
- backup the development with unit tests.
- create data generators that can be used in unit tests.
- written in Java + spring boot + Vaadin.
- minimalistic project status tracking within one single server.
- simple local database, but keep option to switch to other databases.

# Ideas

- introduce ai summary for all projects.
- Take a look how jira is sending fields to the client and replicate if it is good.
- Projects can be locked for change, which will lock start/end dates and all milestones
- project priority can be changed by moving them within the list
- sprint priority can be changed by moving them within the list

# Issues

- sometimes adding a story and two tasks will add additionally one task.
- changing assignment must also change hidden dependencies
- some tests fail with java.awt.HeadlessException.
- some ai filter test fail all the time, as the tests are vague.
- users are retired by their name instead of their email address.
- user email addresses must be unique.
- LocationDialog not showing errors in dialog.
- AvailabilityTest.userSecurity() generates several exceptions on server side that the test does not catch.
- gantt calendar too light.
- gantt calendar should be using sprint calendar.
