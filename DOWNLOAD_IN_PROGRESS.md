# ✅ Index TTS Container - Download in Progress!

## 🎉 SUCCESS! All Fixes Working!

Your container is now running correctly and downloading models!

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Correct Model Path ✅

```
INFO:__main__:Model path: /opt/index-tts/checkpoints
```

**Fixed!** No longer `/models`

### 2. Python API Download ✅

```
INFO:__main__:Downloading from HuggingFace (using Python API)...
```

**Fixed!** No more CLI errors!

### 3. Models Downloading ✅

Files appearing in `E:\github\project-hub\docker\index-tts\checkpoints\`:

**Small files (already downloaded):**

- ✅ `config.yaml` - Model configuration
- ✅ `bpe.model` - Tokenizer (0.45 MB)
- ✅ `feat1.pt` - Speaker features (0.05 MB)
- ✅ `feat2.pt` - Emotion features (0.36 MB)
- ✅ `wav2vec2bert_stats.pt` - Stats (0.01 MB)

**Large files (downloading now):**

- ⏳ Large model files (~70-80 MB each downloading)
- ⏳ `tokenizer.json` (10.89 MB downloaded)
- ⏳ More files in progress...

### 4. No PyTorch Errors ✅

No `torchvision::nms` errors! PyTorch 2.1.2 working correctly!

---

## ⏰ Download Progress

**Status:** Models downloading (~3-5GB total)

**Current:** Small files complete, large models in progress

**Time:** Will take 10-20 minutes depending on internet speed

**What's happening:**

- HuggingFace is downloading files to your host directory
- Files with `.incomplete` suffix are still downloading
- Once complete, they'll be renamed to final names (e.g., `gpt.pth`, `s2mel.pth`)

---

## 👀 Watch the Download

### In Windows Explorer:

```
E:\github\project-hub\docker\index-tts\checkpoints\
```

Files will appear as they download! Refresh to see progress.

### In Terminal:

```cmd
# Watch logs (Ctrl+C when done)
index-tts-helper.bat logs -f

# Check file sizes
dir E:\github\project-hub\docker\index-tts\checkpoints\*.pth
```

---

## 📊 What to Expect

### During Download:

```
INFO:__main__:Downloading from HuggingFace (using Python API)...
[Files downloading in background...]
```

### After Download Complete:

```
INFO:__main__:Models downloaded successfully!
INFO:__main__:Using device: cuda
INFO:__main__:Loading Index TTS v2 model...
INFO:__main__:Using config: /opt/index-tts/checkpoints/config.yaml
>> GPT weights restored from: /opt/index-tts/checkpoints/gpt.pth
>> S2mel weights restored from: /opt/index-tts/checkpoints/s2mel.pth
>> Vocoder loaded
INFO:__main__:Index TTS v2 model loaded successfully! ✅
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### Final Files (After Complete):

```
checkpoints\
├── config.yaml (3 KB)
├── gpt.pth (~1-2 GB) ← Main model
├── s2mel.pth (~500 MB) ← Semantic-to-mel model
├── qwen0.6bemo4-merge\ (directory ~1 GB)
├── bpe.model (450 KB)
├── tokenizer.json (11 MB)
├── feat1.pt (50 KB)
├── feat2.pt (360 KB)
├── wav2vec2bert_stats.pt (10 KB)
└── ... (more files)
```

## ⚠️ Harmless Warning

You'll see this warning:

```
UserWarning: `local_dir_use_symlinks` parameter is deprecated and will be ignored.
```

**This is harmless!** It's just HuggingFace telling us they changed their API. The download still works perfectly. We
can remove that parameter in server.py later.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Download (10-20 min)

Just let it run! The container will:

1. Download all model files (~3-5 GB)
2. Load the models
3. Start the server
4. Be ready to generate speech!

### 2. Check When Complete

```cmd
# Check logs
index-tts-helper.bat logs | findstr "loaded successfully"

# Should show:
# Index TTS v2 model loaded successfully!
```

### 3. Test the API

Once you see "Application startup complete":

```cmd
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5124/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"healthy","model_loaded":true,"device":"cuda","cuda_available":true}
```

### 4. Generate Your First Speech!

```cmd
curl -X POST http://localhost:5124/v1/audio/speech ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"input\":\"Hello! I am Index TTS version 2 with emotional speech synthesis.\",\"emotions\":{\"happy\":0.8,\"neutral\":0.2}}" ^
  -o test_speech.wav
```

## 📁 Models Persist!

These models are now on your host system at:

```
E:\github\project-hub\docker\index-tts\checkpoints\
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Only download once!
- ✅ Future rebuilds are fast (2-3 min)
- ✅ Can browse in Windows Explorer
- ✅ Easy to backup/restore

## 📞 When Download Completes

Let me know when you see:

```
INFO:__main__:Index TTS v2 model loaded successfully!
```

Then we can test speech generation! 🎤
