/**
 * Integration test for the LocationListView UI component.
 * Tests CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for location records in the UI.
 * <p>
 * These tests verify that:
 * - Location records can be created with appropriate details
 * - Created records appear correctly in the list
 * - Records can be edited and changes are reflected in the UI
 * - Records can be deleted from the system
 * - Cancellation of operations works as expected
 * - Validation rules are enforced (unique start dates)
 * <p>
 * The tests account for the fact that each user already has an initial location record
 * for the current date when they're created.
 * <p>
 * The tests use {@link LocationViewTester} to interact with the UI elements
 * and verify the expected behavior.
